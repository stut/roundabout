Roundabout
==========

Roundabout is a standalone HTML file that simply a bunch of URLs and cycles
around them according to the provided delays. Initially created to be used
with Grafana but should be useful for any dashboard system where the playlist
functionality is sadly lacking. It could also be useful for displaying
advertising or cycling through other periodically changing content.

There's a lot more that could be done with this but the idea was to keep it as
